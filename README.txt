### IN MY FEELINGS ###
This site integrates 3 different APIs to help suggest content to a user based on how
they are feeling.
When working off the localhost all APIs worked seamlessly, however once hosting ran into some issues with
mixed-content and CORS. I tried to troubleshoot the problem and integrated several different solutions but none
seemed to solve my issue.

You can visit https://in-my-feelings.herokuapp.com/ to see the Noun Project API and the Movie Database API working
and you can visit http://in-my-feelings.herokuapp.com/ to see the GoogleBooks API and the Movie Database API working

If you have any ideas on how I can get all three APIs working at once on the same URL I would appreciate any feedback!
